# Ski-Free-Clone

This is a game made as part of the **`EGC`** Elements of Computer Graphics, BSc year 3 course &mdash; [using this framework](https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework)

The game is heavily inspired by SkiFree, and is missing many features from the original game. This one is 3D, though!

# Features
- Procedural generation
- Increasing speed over time played
- Life and Score systems
- Lighting and Particle effects

# Building

Check the [framework GitHub page](https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework) for more on how to build the thing!

# TODO
- A more compelling gameplay loop.
- Actual enemies, perhaps a "chasing monster" that continually follows you and forces you to not stall for as long (moving diagonally is slower than straight down)
- More levels and variations.
- Use a Shader Storage Buffer Object (SSBO) to have a variable amount of lights instead of a set number.
