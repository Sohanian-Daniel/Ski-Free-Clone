# Ski-Free-Clone

This is a game made as part of the **`EGC`** Elements of Computer Graphics, BSc year 3 course &mdash; [using this framework](https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework)

The game is heavily inspired by SkiFree, and is missing many features from the original game. This one is 3D, though!
